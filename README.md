# Three Bugs

Hello!

In this challenge, you will be flexing your debugging muscle. The code provided has three significant bugs in it to produce a result that is undesirable. You will need to go through and figure out where the bugs exist and make the needed corrections to produce a better looking result.

You will need to think critically and step through the code. From the beginning, you should be going line by line, trying to understand what the code is doing, decide whether or not the code should do that, test your hypothesis, and adjust your plan at each step.

To help guide you, here are hints around each of the bugs:
1. Why is only one name being produced for each bullet, shouldnâ€™t it be a unique name at each bullet point?
2. That is a ton of decimal places.
3. Why is there a negative STI adjustment? Those numbers also seem big

Make sure to fork or download this repo so that you have your own instance of the code. Make the corrections, then upload them to your own repo.


STI - Three Bugs - Object Upgrade

Description
Hey Everyone!

For this challenge, you need to upgrade 'the people' to be objects rather than just arrays of information. Specifically: var arrayAtticus = [Atticus, 2405, 47000, 3]; var arrayJem = [Jem, 62347, 63500, 4]; var arrayBoo = [Boo, 11435, 54000, 3]; var arrayScout = [Scout, 6243, 74750, 5];

Should each become an instance of an object (Probably called something like 'Person'). This will also mean that you need to adjust the rest of the logic to accept keys rather than array locations. The array that is used to store each person does not need to be converted to an object. Meaning that you can put your new Person objects inside of an array to be processed.

Once you are complete, post to GitHub and submit via this app.

STI - Three Bugs - Final Step

Three Bugs Final Step
In this final step working with the code of the 'Three Bugs' challenge, you are going to bring in jQuery. Specifically, you will need to bring in jQuery into the project and use it to write the results that were previously being console logged, to the DOM.

Create a function that accepts an employee object (note, that you will need to convert the output from the main function 'calculateSTI' to produce an Object, rather than an array), and uses the information in that object to append each person's name, salary, bonus, and post-bonus total compensation.

Hard Mode
Make it look great! Flex some of those CSS Chops to organize the information in a way that is meaningful and eye-catching (remember, good design is subtle). You will need to include a CSS file as well to style everything up.
